# Familiarization with GitHub

This is my first repo on GitHub just to get familiar with the platform and do a little bit of revision. What I have done will also be documented on this page just for future reference.

I have specifically followed the [GitHub Fundamentals](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/github-fundamentals) course on Pluralsight to help give me some guidence.

For help with the syntax of the README.md file I referred to [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://help.github.com/en/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).
